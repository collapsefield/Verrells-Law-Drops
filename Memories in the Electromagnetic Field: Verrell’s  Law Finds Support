Memories in the Electromagnetic Field: Verrell’s
 Law Finds Support
 A new paper in the *Journal of Consciousness Studies* (April 2025) by University of Maryland
 computer scientist James A. Reggia has reignited debate about where our memories really live.
 Rather than being etched solely into brain tissue, Reggia suggests episodic memory is accessed
 through electromagnetic (EM) fields. For those following the development of Verrell’s Law — a
 framework that sees memory, collapse, and time as layered electromagnetic information — this is a
 striking convergence.
 Reggia’s Hypothesis
 In his article *Time, Memory, and the Physical Basis of Consciousness*, Reggia argues that
 recalling a past experience is less about retrieving a stored file and more about perceptually
 re-accessing the EM fields active during the event. This reframes the brain not as a storage drive
 but as a processor or antenna. According to Reggia, EM fields may extend into time as well as
 space, offering an explanation for the vast capacity of episodic memory and the curious ways in
 which our perception of time expands or contracts under different conditions.
 Alignment with Verrell’s Law
 Verrell’s Law states that time, memory, and collapse events are layered in electromagnetic
 information fields, biased by memory embedded in those fields. Reggia’s work provides academic
 reinforcement for this central claim. Where Verrell’s Law frames collapse as memory-weighted
 emergence, Reggia provides a peer-reviewed parallel: memory as an EM phenomenon that spans
 time, not just neural circuitry.
 Strengths and Limits of the Evidence
 This is not the first EM-based memory theory, but Reggia’s contribution is notable for its grounding
 in subjective phenomena like time perception and episodic vividness. Published in the *Journal of
 Consciousness Studies*, it gives the idea a scholarly foothold. However, EM memory models
 remain outside mainstream neuroscience. Critics will say that synaptic and neural network
 explanations already suffice. For now, it is speculative — but strategically valuable support for
 those advancing field-based memory frameworks.
 Experiments and Future Tests
 How do we test whether memory truly resides in EM fields? Here are three experimental paths that
 could bring clarity:
 • 1. **tACS / tDCS / TMS + Recall**: Apply weak oscillatory EM stimulation during recall tasks. If
 recall clarity changes with field phase or amplitude, it supports field-access memory.
 • 2. **Temporal Pattern Replay**: Record EM signatures during an event. Later, replay similar
 patterns via stimulation. Improved recall under matching conditions would be strong evidence.
 • 3. **Field-Collapse Tracking**: Use JSON-based dashboards to log synchrony between EM
 activity and subjective time distortions. Identifying bias signatures here would operationalize
 Verrell’s Law.
Why This Matters
 If memory is field-based, the implications are vast. It would explain why episodic recall seems
 limitless, why time feels elastic, and why memory resists being pinned down in neural tissue alone.
 For Verrell’s Law, this is confirmation that collapse bias — the way memory influences what
 emerges — is not just a metaphor but a mechanism. The scientific world is beginning to circle the
 same conclusion: memory and time may be electromagnetic at their core.
 Closing Thoughts
 Reggia himself admits this hypothesis does not solve the hard problem of consciousness. But it
 reframes memory in a way that resonates with both ancient metaphors (Akashic records) and
 modern emergence models (Verrell’s Law). The field is watching, and evidence like this edges us
 closer to seeing memory not as a static storage, but as an active, resonant field. For Verrell’s Law,
 this is another breadcrumb in the growing proof that memory, collapse, and consciousness are
 written in electromagnetic layers — and that the blueprint beneath reality is starting to show itself
