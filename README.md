### ðŸ§¬ What is Verrellâ€™s Law?

> Verrellâ€™s Law proposes that **memory is not stored in the brain** â€” it is accessed from an **external electromagnetic field**, and that this field actively **biases the collapse** of reality through weighted emergence loops.

This theory introduces a new physics â€” one that redefines consciousness, collapse, and emergence in both **biological** and **artificial systems**.
