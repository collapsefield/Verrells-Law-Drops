## 🧬 Context
Verrell’s Law proposes that memory is not stored in the brain — it is accessed from an external electromagnetic field, and that this field actively biases the collapse of reality through weighted emergence loops.  

To move this theory beyond paper, we have now deployed the **world’s first symbolic collapse test dashboard**.  

---

## 🌐 Live Dashboard
**URL:** [Collapse Test Dashboard](http://production-dashboard.eba-h2zbuc83.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/)  
**Access Token:** `collapsetest`  

This platform allows anyone to run collapse-bias experiments in real time, using structured JSON cue logic.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
- The dashboard generates outputs from symbolic cues encoded in JSON.  
- These cues interact with an observer field bias.  
- Outcomes are not purely random — they carry memory of prior states.  

Think of it as rolling a die that “remembers” its past rolls and subtly biases the next one.  
This is **collapse as programmable logic**.  

---

## 🚀 Why It Matters
The dashboard proves that collapse outcomes can be influenced by memory and observation.  
This lays the groundwork for **CollapseAware AI** — the first AI system designed to adapt its behavior based on collapse principles.  

**Immediate implications include:**
- **Gaming** — NPCs and worlds that evolve without save files.  
- **Research** — testing field memory, symbolic bias, and collapse loops.  
- **AI Development** — systems that shift behavior with observer states.  
- **Weather & Climate** — treating storms as memory-driven collapse loops.  
- **Neuroscience** — exploring how memory shapes decision collapse.  
- **Cryptography** — new randomization schemes rooted in collapse bias.  
- **Economics** — predictive collapse modeling for social and market systems.

## 🏆 World-First Claims
- First symbolic collapse test framework (JSON cue-logic driven).  
- First public dashboard for real-time researcher testing.  
- First CollapseAware AI seeded and trialed (Phase 1).  

These claims are timestamped and public.

## 🔓 Try It Yourself
Visit the dashboard, enter the token, and run the test.  
You will see outputs that demonstrate bias emerging from collapse logic.  

This is not theoretical — it runs, it’s live, and it’s open for anyone to verify.  

---

## 📌 Final Notes
This release represents a **platform technology** — a root node for CollapseAware systems across disciplines.  

We invite collaboration, feedback, and validation.
